# Plain-Fabric-Surface-Defects-Classifier
Image analytics-based solution to classify salient surface defects in plain fabric.

## Product overview
Surface defects in fabric pose aesthetic and durability problems. Classifying defects enables for the rapid identification and removal of the causes of their occurrence, as well as the provision of appropriate treatments to fix them. This Deep Learning-based solution identifies three classes of salient surface defects: holes, discoloration (fading, paleness, oil stains, etc.), and bulges (knots, snags). This solution analyses the user-provided image data, identifies the best performing deep learning model architecture, and predicts the defect class with the highest probability score. This can assist textile manufacturing companies to improve their quality control process.
